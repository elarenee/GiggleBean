1. allBlinkingTargetsTouched() is now allBlinkingTargetsStretched()
	touches on other regions / movement of the whole structure may
	register as touches on other regions. so to avoid this issue,
	only play song on hard touches of blinking regions.
2. sound array now belongs to speaker, instead of each target having its own
	same issue with that touch nonsense. this way we only play one giggle
	or bo'ing at a time. won't start again until it is done playing.
